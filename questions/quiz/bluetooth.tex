\question{Consider the Bluetooth Authentication sketched in the figure below.}
\begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A sends its Public Key PKa
        \item B sends its Public Ket PKb
        \item B selects a Random value Nb
        \item A selects a Random value Na
        \item B computes the confirmation Cb = f4(Pkb, Pia, Nb, 0)
        \item B sends the confirmation Cb to A
        \item A sends its nonce Na
        \item B sends its nonce Nb
        \item A checks if Cb = f4(Pkb, Pia, Nb, 0)
    \end{enumerate}
\end{solution}

    \choice It consists in brute forcing the PIN.
    \choice It sends a previously recorded frame to misuse the communication.
    \choice It leverages the signal to noise ratio to authenticate the device.
    \choice None of the other options
\end{checkboxes}
