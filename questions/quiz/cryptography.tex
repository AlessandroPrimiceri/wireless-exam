\question{Associate the correct definition to the following security mechanisms}
\begin{solution}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Access Control}: Determines and enforce the access rights of the entity depending on the authenticated identity. Provides confidentiality for either data or traffic flow information.
        \item \textbf{Encipherment}: Provides confidentiality for either data or traffic flow information.
        \item \textbf{Traffic Padding}: Protects against traffic analysis attacks by adding non essential data to network communications. Assures data integrity, origin, time, and destination about data communicated between two or more entities.
        \item \textbf{Notarization}: Assures data integrity, origin, time, and destination about data communicated between two or more entities.
