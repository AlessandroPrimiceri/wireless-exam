\question{Power saving mode in 802.11 + attack}

\question{Consider a setup in which 2 STA (STA-1 and STA-2) are connected to the same WLAN managed by an AP. A third device (ETH-1) is connected with Ethernet technology. For each setup, describe and justify the expected goodput in the following cases:
    \begin{parts}
        \part Scenario 1 (3 points): Both STA-1 and STA-2 use 802.11g on the ISM band. ETH-1 uses Fast Ethernet
        technology with a physical link capacity of 100Mb/s
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item STA-1 sends data to ETH-1 using UDP
            \item STA-1 sends data to ETH-1 using TCP
            \item STA-1 sends data to STA-2 using UDP
            \item STA-1 sends data to STA-2 using TCP
        \end{enumerate}

        \part Scenario 2 (2 points): What changes if STA-1 now connects to the same WLAN but using the 5GHz band?
        Again, consider the cases
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item STA-1 sends data to ETH-1 using UDP
            \item STA-1 sends data to ETH-1 using TCP
            \item STA-1 sends data to STA-2 using UDP
            \item STA-1 sends data to STA-2 using TCP
        \end{enumerate}

        \part Scenario 3 (1 point): what changes if now both STA-1 (on 5GHz band) and STA-2 (on 2.4GHz band) upgrade
        their technology to using 802.11ax (WiFi 6)?
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item STA-1 sends data to ETH-1 using UDP
            \item STA-1 sends data to ETH-1 using TCP
            \item STA-1 sends data to STA-2 using UDP
            \item STA-1 sends data to STA-2 using TCP
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{parts}
    Consider UDP header of 8B, TCP header of 20B, IP header of 20B, Ethernet header of 38B.

\question{Consider a setup in which 2 STA (STA-1 and STA-2) are connected to the same WLAN managed by an AP. A third device (ETH-1) is connected with Ethernet technology. For each setup, describe and justify the expected goodput in the following cases:
\begin{parts}
    \part[3] Scenario 1: Both STA-1 and STA-2 use 802.11g on the ISM band. ETH-1 uses Gigabit Ethernet technology with a physical link capacity of 1000Mb/s
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item ETH-1 sends data to STA-1 using UDP
        \item ETH-1 sends data to STA-1 using TCP
        \item ETH-1 sends data to STA-1 and STA-2 at the same time using UDP
        \item ETH-1 sends data to STA-1 and STA-2 at the same time using TCP
    \end{enumerate}

    \part[2] Scenario 2: What changes if STA-1 now connects to the same WLAN but using the 5GHz band? Again, consider the cases

        \item ETH-1 sends data to STA-1 and STA-2 at the same time using TCP
    \end{enumerate}

    \part[1] Scenario 3: what changes if now both STA-1 (on 5GHz band) and STA-2 (on 2.4GHz band) upgrade their technology to using 802.11ax (WiFi 6) with maximum data rate of 1.1Gb/s each?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item ETH-1 sends data to STA-1 using UDP
        \item ETH-1 sends data to STA-1 using TCP
        \item ETH-1 sends data to STA-1 and STA-2 at the same time using UDP
        \item ETH-1 sends data to STA-1 and STA-2 at the same time using TCP
    \end{enumerate}

\question{Describe the frames exchanged by an STA and an AP to inform the STA about the SSID of the AP; what kind of attack exploits this mechanism?}

\question{Describe step For OPEN AUTH system when the AP communicates ESSID and when not}
