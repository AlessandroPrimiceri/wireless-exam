## GNSS

**How can a spoofing attack be detected?**

**Why is monitoring the GNSS spectrum alone often insufficient for comprehensive spoofing detection?**
- [ ] Spectrum monitoring is too slow to detect real-time attacks.
- [x] It only detects changes in signal strength and frequency, not the content or integrity of the signals.
- [x] Spoofers can closely mimic legitimate signal parameters, making detection challenging.
- [ ] It cannot differentiate between different types of interference.
- [ ] None of the other options.

**Which of the following is generally ***NOT*** an effective spoofing detection method?**
- [ ] Implement cryptographic authentication to verify the authenticity of GNSS signals, ensuring they originate from legitimate satellites.
- [ ] Cross-checking GNSS data with other navigation systems like inertial navigation sensors or signals from multiple GNSS constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou) and frequencies.
- [ ] Use antennas that can determine the direction of incoming signals, allowing the receiver to distinguish between legitimate and spoofed signals based on direction.
- [ ] Monitor the strength of GNSS signals. Sudden increases in signal strength can indicate spoofing attempts.
- [x] Monitor the frequency spectrum in the GNSS band. Frequency spikes generally indicate the presence of a spoofer in that band.


**Why is it important to receive signals in Line-of-Sight to build profitable pseudoranges?**
- [x] Because line-of-sight signals are not delayed by reflections. Multipath can cause the receiver to calculate a longer travel time, leading to erroneous pseudorange calculations.
- [x] Because Line-of-sight signals travel the shortest and most direct path from the satellite to the receiver. This ensures that the signal strength is higher and minimal attenuation is experienced leading to a higher signal-to-noise ratio.
- [ ] Because satellites in line-of-sight yield to better geometrical conditions to estimate the position and therefore to a lower GDOP.
- [ ] Because measurements performed in line-of-sight maintain synchronization between the user and the satellite.
- [ ] None of the other options.


**What is broadcasted by the satellite**

**Is out-of-band interference detrimental for GNSS signals? Why?**
- [ ] Yes. GNSS frequency bands are reserved only in the country that owns each system (e.g., the US for GPS, the EU for Galileo), therefore, other signal transmissions can freely interfere with those bands in most regions.
- [ ] No. GNSS frequency bands are reserved, and no other signal transmission interferes with those bands.
- [ ] No. GNSS signals are generally very weak; however, the use of spread spectrum codes makes them invulnerable to interference.
- [ ] None of the other options.
- [X] Yes. Since GNSS signals are generally very weak, strong out-of-band spillovers of powerful signals can interfere with the GNSS band.

**Which of the following is a common indicator of a GNSS spoofing attack?**
- [ ] A gradual decrease in signal strength over time
- [ ] Enhanced accuracy and reliability of GNSS signals
- [ ] Sudden and significant deviations in position, velocity or time calculations
- [ ] None of the others
- [ ] Discrepancies between GNSS-based positions and those from alternative navigation systems (e.g., inertial navigation systems)

- [ ] None of the other options.
- [ ] Yes, but there is a constant time-invariant offset.

- [ ] A pseudorange is a range measurement when such measurement is obtained through a signal.
- [ ] A pseudorange is a range affected by an unsolvable measurement error.
