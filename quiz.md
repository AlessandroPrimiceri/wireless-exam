## Signals and basics

**Why the definition of the bandwidth 3db**

**PSK modulation - about the energy level of symbols and saturation level of a power amplifier**

- [ ] The bitrate decreases, but the system becomes more robust to errors.
- [x] The bitrate increases, but the system becomes more error prone.
- [ ] The bandwidth efficiency increases resulting in a generally larger bandwidth of the transmitted signals.
- [ ] The bandwidth efficiency decreases resulting in a generally larger bandwidth of the transmitted signals.

## GNSS

**How can a spoofing attack be detected?**

**Why is monitoring the GNSS spectrum alone often insufficient for comprehensive spoofing detection?**
- [ ] Spectrum monitoring is too slow to detect real-time attacks.
- [x] It only detects changes in signal strength and frequency, not the content or integrity of the signals.
- [x] Spoofers can closely mimic legitimate signal parameters, making detection challenging.
- [ ] It cannot differentiate between different types of interference.
- [ ] None of the other options.


**Why is it important to receive signals in Line-of-Sight to build profitable pseudoranges?**

- [x] Because line-of-sight signals are not delayed by reflections. Multipath can cause the receiver to calculate a longer travel time, leading to erroneous pseudorange calculations.
- [x] Because Line-of-sight signals travel the shortest and most direct path from the satellite to the receiver. This ensures that the signal strength is higher and minimal attenuation is experienced leading to a higher signal-to-noise ratio.
- [ ] Because satellites in line-of-sight yield to better geometrical conditions to estimate the position and therefore to a lower GDOP.
- [ ] Because measurements performed in line-of-sight maintain synchronization between the user and the satellite.
- [ ] None of the other options.



**Are the clocks of Satellite and receiver synchronized?**

**What is broadcasted by the satellite**

**Do Out-Of-Band interferences affect GNSS?**

**Which of the following is a common indicator of a GNSS spoofing attack?**
- [ ] A gradual decrease in signal strength over time
- [ ] Enhanced accuracy and reliability of GNSS signals
- [ ] Sudden and significant deviations in position, velocity or time calculations
- [ ] None of the others
- [ ] Discrepancies between GNSS-based positions and those from alternative navigation systems (e.g., inertial navigation systems)

**GNSS difference between range and pseudorange**

**Sort the exchanged messages to connect to an AP**

**Algorithm used in OWE**

**How WEP key management ic compared to WPA/WPA2**

**why not csma/ cd in wifi**

**authentication service - in the context of wireless networks**

**CDMA networks - why is power control important?**

**Purpose of DIFS in wifi networks**

**802.11 network - using ISM BW range, how many independent channels can be used?**

5. 802.11n, RTS/CTS enabled, TCP+IP
6. 802.11g, RTS/CTS disabled, TCP+IP
7. 802.11g, RTS/CTS enabled, TCP+IP

**WLAN attacks**
- [ ] WEP
- [ ] NAV
- [ ] ROGUE AP
- [ ] DEAUTH
- [ ] CHOP-CHOP

**Which of the following information would an attacker require to mount a de-authentication attack against one specific STA in a WLAN?**
- [x] The AP MAC address
- [x] The STA MAC address
- [x] The WLAN channel
- [ ] The WLAN ESSID
- [ ] None of the other options.



**Why in 802.11 there are two destination mac addresses?**
- [x] The first indicates the AP that has to receive the frame. The second indicates the interface of the router that frame is destined to.
- [ ] To correctly identify the STA sending the frame.
- [ ] For anonymisation.
- [ ] For error correction.
- [ ] None of the other options.

**Consider the case a STA would like to transmit a frame to the AP. No other transmissions are present. RTS/CTS are disabled. Put in the correct order over time the sequence of events that would occur:**
1. A waits for DIFS time
2. A sends the DATA(A) frame
3. AP receives the DATA(A) frame
4. AP waits for SIFS time
5. AP sends ACK(A)
6. The transmission is completed


## WPAN / Bluetooth

**How does Bluetooth Classic handle privacy concerns compared to Bluetooth LE?**

**Ss7 vulnerability**

**Purpose of paging and location are in mobile network**

**What is the difference between the Visitor Location Register (VLR) and the Home Location Register (HLR) in GSM networks?**
- [x] The VLR is a temporary database that stores information about subscribers currently roaming in the coverage area, while the HLR is a permanent database that contains detailed subscriber information and is maintained by the subscriber's home network.
- [ ] The VLR handles billing and account information for roaming subscribers, while the HLR manages encryption keys and authentication data.
