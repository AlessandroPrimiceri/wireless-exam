## GNSS
**How can a spoofing attack be detected?**

**Why monitoring GNSS spectrum is insufficient for spoofing detection?**

**GNSS - Why is line of sight to satellites important to have correct pseudorange calculations?**

**What is broadcasted by the satellite**

**Is out-of-band interference detrimental for GNSS signals? Why?**
- [ ] Yes. GNSS frequency bands are reserved only in the country that owns each system (e.g., the US for GPS, the EU for Galileo), therefore, other signal transmissions can freely interfere with those bands in most regions.
- [ ] No. GNSS frequency bands are reserved, and no other signal transmission interferes with those bands.
- [ ] No. GNSS signals are generally very weak; however, the use of spread spectrum codes makes them invulnerable to interference.
- [ ] None of the other options.
- [X] Yes. Since GNSS signals are generally very weak, strong out-of-band spillovers of powerful signals can interfere with the GNSS band.

**Which of the following is a common indicator of a GNSS spoofing attack?**
- [ ] A gradual decrease in signal strength over time
- [ ] Enhanced accuracy and reliability of GNSS signals
- [ ] Sudden and significant deviations in position, velocity or time calculations
- [ ] None of the others
- [ ] Discrepancies between GNSS-based positions and those from alternative navigation systems (e.g., inertial navigation systems)

**Are the user and satellite clock synchronized in a GNSS?**
- [ ] None of the other options.
- [ ] Yes, but there is a constant time-invariant offset.
- [ ] Yes, always.
- [ ] No, never. Neither before nor after the user position estimation.
- [X] Not really. However, the user clock can be considered synchronized after the
continuous estimation of the user clock bias which is time-varying.

**GNSS difference between range and pseudorange**

- [ ] WEP
- [ ] NAV
- [ ] ROGUE AP
- [ ] DEAUTH
- [ ] CHOP-CHOP

**Why in 802.11 there are two destination mac addresses?**
- [ ] In case there are multiple APs, to indicate the two APs that should receive and process the frame.
- [ ] For error correction
- [ ] For anonymisation
- [X] None of the other options.
- [ ] To correctly identify the STA sending the frame 

**What type of encryption does OWE use to secure data in transit?**
- [X] Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish a shared secret.
- [ ] Asymmetric encryption using RSA keys.
- [ ] Symmetric key encryption with a pre-shared key.
- [ ] None of the other options.
- [ ] Static encryption keys manually configured by the user.

**Consider two STA, A and B, that belong to a WLAN managed by an AP. RTS/CTS are DISABLED.
A and B wake up at the same time to send a data frame, creating thus a collision.
Put in the right sequence the frames and events that could occur in time.**
1. A wait for DIFS and sends a DATA(A) frame 
2. B wait for DIFS and sends a DATA(B) frame 
3. DATA(A) collides with DATA(B) 
4. A and B wait for the AP's ACK 
5. Neither A nor B received the ACK, so they backoff 
6. A wait 10ms and tries to retransmit DATA(A) 
7. B wait 20ms and listen to the channel, sensing its busy with DATA(A) transmission
8. AP receives DATA(A)
9. AP sends an ACK to A

- [ ] Bluetooth Classic uses encryption keys for all data transmissions.
- [ ] Bluetooth Classic limits the number of devices that can connect simultaneously.

**Purpose of paging and location are in mobile network**

**What is the difference between the Visitor Location Register (VLR) and the Home Location Register (HLR) in GSM networks?**

- [ ] The VLR handles billing and account information for roaming subscribers, while the HLR manages encryption keys and authentication data.
- [ ] The VLR stores the IMSI and Ki keys, while the HLR stores the subscriber's phonebook and SMS messages.
- [ ] The VLR is responsible for managing voice call routing, while the HLR handles data transmission services.
- [ ] None of the other options.
